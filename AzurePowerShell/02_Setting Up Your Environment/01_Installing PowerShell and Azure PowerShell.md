To install PowerShell and Azure PowerShell, you can follow these steps:

### Installing PowerShell:

1. **Windows**:
   - PowerShell comes pre-installed on most recent versions of Windows. You can check if it's installed by opening PowerShell and typing `Get-Host`.

2. **macOS**:
   - Download and install PowerShell Core from the [PowerShell GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases).

3. **Linux**:
   - Installation steps vary depending on the distribution. You can find installation instructions for various Linux distributions on the [PowerShell GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

### Installing Azure PowerShell:

1. **Using PowerShell Gallery**:
   - Open PowerShell with administrator privileges.
   - Run the following command to install the Azure PowerShell module:
     ```powershell
     Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope AllUsers
     ```
   - If prompted to install from an untrusted repository, type `Y` and press Enter.

2. **Updating the Azure PowerShell Module (Optional)**:
   - You can update the Azure PowerShell module to the latest version using the following command:
     ```powershell
     Update-Module -Name Az
     ```

3. **Verifying Installation**:
   - After installation, you can import the Azure PowerShell module by running:
     ```powershell
     Import-Module Az
     ```

### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.
- For Linux and macOS, make sure you have the required dependencies installed before installing PowerShell.
- Regularly update both PowerShell and Azure PowerShell to the latest versions to access new features and improvements.

Once both PowerShell and Azure PowerShell are installed, you can start using Azure PowerShell cmdlets to manage your Azure resources directly from the command line.
