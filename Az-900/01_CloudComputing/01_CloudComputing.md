1. **On-Demand Delivery:** Cloud computing offers resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more as a service. Users can access these resources instantly without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

2. **Resource Pooling:** Cloud providers pool resources to serve multiple customers, allowing for efficient resource utilization and scalability. This pooling enables cost savings and flexibility for users.

3. **Internet Connectivity:** Cloud services are accessed over the internet, providing ubiquitous access to resources from anywhere with an internet connection. Users can connect to cloud services using various devices, including computers, smartphones, and tablets.

4. **Self-Service Provisioning:** Users can provision and manage cloud resources independently through web interfaces or APIs. This self-service model empowers users to quickly deploy and scale resources based on their requirements without the need for human intervention from the cloud provider.

5. **Elasticity and Scalability:** Cloud resources can scale up or down dynamically based on demand. This elasticity allows users to handle fluctuations in workload efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

6. **Pay-Per-Use Billing:** Cloud services typically follow a pay-per-use or subscription-based billing model, where users only pay for the resources they consume. This flexible pricing model allows organizations to align their costs with actual usage and avoid upfront investments in infrastructure.

7. **Managed Services:** Cloud providers offer a wide range of managed services, including databases, machine learning, analytics, and security services. These managed services offload maintenance and management tasks to the cloud provider, allowing users to focus on building and deploying applications.

Overall, cloud computing provides a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective approach to accessing IT resources, enabling organizations to innovate, scale, and adapt to changing business needs more effectively.





## Cloud Computing Advantages

### Infrastructure 
 Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS)/Azure/GCP.
### Global in Minutes (Deploy application in minutes)
 With Cloud Computing you can expand your business by deploying the application(in minutes) on different regions. It is matter of few clicks the application get deployed in multiple physical locations. 
### Infinite Storage 
 With Cloud Computeing you can find infinite storage to store any type of data.
### Cost Saving(pay as you go)
 With Cloud Computing you can go with <b>pay as you go </b> cost model that means the charges are based upon the usage of cloud services.For example the charges on storage is based upon the amount of storage used.
### Agility (quickly & easily)
 You can innovate faster and quickly anything which you imagine with the help of broad range of technologies provided by Cloud. You can spin up the resources like virtual servers, storage,IOTs,machine learning etc in minutes.
### Dynamic Scaling -Elasticity 
 With Cloud Computing you can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.
### Disaster Assitance
 With Cloud Computing you can configure the disaster recovery options to backup your data.
### Easily Upgrade
 With Cloud Computing you can easily upgrade Hardware/software/Increase or decrease storage/Network  configurations etc.
### Highly Available
 If you configure resources using Cloud Computing then there is a SLA (service level agreement) defined which ensures the high availability of the services.
