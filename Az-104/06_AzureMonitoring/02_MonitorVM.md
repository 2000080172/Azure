Azure Monitor provides monitoring capabilities for both virtual machines (VMs) and other Azure services, including Activity Logs(External Operation logs). Here's how it works for each:

1. **Virtual Machine Metrics(in form of number) Monitoring**:
   - Azure Monitor collects a wide range of metrics from virtual machines, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and more.
   - You can view these metrics in real-time using Azure Monitor metrics explorer, which provides charts and graphs to visualize the performance of your VMs.
   - Additionally, you can set up alerts based on these metrics to notify you when certain conditions are met, such as high CPU usage or low available disk space.
   - Azure Monitor also allows you to enable diagnostic settings for your VMs, which stream diagnostic logs and metrics to Azure Monitor Logs (formerly known as Log Analytics). This enables you to perform more advanced analysis and create custom dashboards and alerts based on VM log data.

2. **Activity Logs Monitoring(External Operation Log)**:
   - Azure Monitor collects activity logs (also known as audit logs or operational logs) for all Azure resources, including virtual machines.
   - These logs contain information about operations performed on your resources, such as VM creation, deletion, start, stop, and more.
   - You can view and analyze these logs in the Azure portal using Azure Monitor, and you can also stream them to Azure Monitor Logs for more advanced analysis and alerting.
   - Azure Monitor allows you to set up alerts based on activity log events, so you can be notified when certain operations occur, such as VM deletions or configuration changes.

3. **Monitoring Other Azure Services**:
   - Azure Monitor provides monitoring capabilities for a wide range of Azure services beyond just virtual machines and activity logs.
   - For each Azure service, Azure Monitor collects metrics and logs specific to that service, allowing you to monitor its performance, health, and usage.
   - You can view these metrics and logs in the Azure portal using Azure Monitor, and you can also set up alerts and create custom dashboards based on this data.
   - Some Azure services may also have additional monitoring features specific to their functionality, which can be accessed through Azure Monitor.

Overall, Azure Monitor provides a unified monitoring solution for monitoring the performance, health, and activity of your virtual machines, as well as other Azure services, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot your Azure resources and applications.
