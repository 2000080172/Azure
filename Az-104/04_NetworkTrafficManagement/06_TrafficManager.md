# Azure Traffic Manager

Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally across multiple endpoints, such as Azure regions, global Azure deployments, or external endpoints. It improves application responsiveness and availability by directing user traffic to the best-performing endpoint based on various criteria, including endpoint health, geographic location, and routing method.

Here's an overview of Azure Traffic Manager and how to use it:

### Key Features:

1. **Global Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple Azure regions or global deployments to improve application availability and responsiveness.

2. **Health Monitoring**: Monitors the health of endpoints and automatically routes traffic away from unhealthy or degraded endpoints.

3. **Traffic Routing Methods**:
   - **Priority**: Routes traffic to the primary endpoint and fails over to secondary endpoints if the primary is unavailable.
   - **Weighted**: Distributes traffic based on user-defined weights assigned to each endpoint.
   - **Performance**: Directs traffic to the endpoint with the lowest network latency.
   - **Geographic**: Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the user.
   - **Subnet**: Routes traffic based on the IP subnet of the user.

4. **DNS-Based Traffic Steering**: Utilizes DNS queries to route traffic, enabling seamless integration with applications without requiring changes to client-side code.

### How to Use Azure Traffic Manager:

1. **Create Traffic Manager Profile**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "Traffic Manager profiles" and click on "Add" to create a new profile.
   - Configure the profile with a unique name, routing method, and other settings based on your requirements.

2. **Add Endpoints**:
   - Add endpoints to your Traffic Manager profile, such as Azure endpoints (Azure App Services, Azure VMs, Azure Front Door, etc.) or external endpoints (websites, APIs, etc.).
   - Configure endpoint monitoring settings to ensure health checks are performed regularly.

3. **Configure Traffic Routing**:
   - Choose the appropriate traffic routing method based on your application's needs (e.g., priority, weighted, performance, geographic).
   - Fine-tune routing settings, such as TTL (Time-To-Live) for DNS responses.

4. **Update DNS Configuration**:
   - After creating the Traffic Manager profile and adding endpoints, Traffic Manager provides a DNS name (e.g., `<profile-name>.trafficmanager.net`).
   - Update your application's DNS records to point to the Traffic Manager DNS name.

5. **Testing and Monitoring**:
   - Test your application to ensure traffic is correctly routed to the desired endpoints.
   - Monitor Traffic Manager metrics and endpoint health status in the Azure portal.

By using Azure Traffic Manager, you can achieve global load balancing, improved application availability, and optimized user experience by directing traffic to the nearest or best-performing endpoint.
