In Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), both public and private IP addresses play important roles in facilitating network communication. Let's explore each type:

1. **Public IP Addresses**:
   - Public IP addresses in Azure are globally routable addresses that are accessible from the internet. They allow Azure resources, such as virtual machines or load balancers, to communicate with external networks and devices over the internet.
   - Public IP addresses are typically used for:
     - Inbound communication: Accessing Azure resources from the internet, such as accessing a website hosted on an Azure VM.
     - Outbound communication: Allowing Azure resources to communicate with external services or resources over the internet.
   - You can assign public IP addresses directly to Azure resources, or you can use Azure Load Balancer or Azure Application Gateway to provide a single public IP address that distributes inbound traffic across multiple backend resources.

 **Public IP Addresses**:
   - **Static Public IP Address**: A static public IP address in Azure is an IP address that remains constant and does not change, even if the associated resource (e.g., virtual machine) is stopped and started. Static public IP addresses are typically used for scenarios where you need a consistent public-facing endpoint, such as hosting a website or configuring a VPN gateway.
   - **Dynamic Public IP Address**: A dynamic public IP address in Azure is an IP address that may change each time the associated resource is restarted or redeployed. Dynamic public IP addresses are suitable for scenarios where the public IP address can change without affecting the functionality of the resource. They are often used for testing environments or transient workloads.

### Public IP addresses SKU 
Basic and Standard. Each SKU offers different features and capabilities tailored to various use cases and requirements. Here's a comparison of the Basic and Standard SKUs for Public IP addresses:

1. **Basic SKU (it will reire on 30Sep,2025)**:
   - **Designed for Simplicity**: The Basic SKU is intended for simple scenarios where basic public IP functionality is required.
   - **Availability**: Basic Public IP addresses are available for free when associated with a VM, Azure Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, or Application Gateway. However, if you want to reserve a Basic Public IP address without associating it with a resource, there may be a small hourly charge.
   - **Dynamic Assignment**: Basic Public IP addresses are dynamically assigned by Azure from a pool of available addresses.
   - **Limited Features**: Basic Public IP addresses offer limited features compared to the Standard SKU. For example, they do not support availability zones, outbound FQDN-based NAT, or Public IP Prefix.

2. **Standard SKU**:
   - **Rich Feature Set**: The Standard SKU offers a richer set of features and capabilities suitable for more complex networking scenarios and production environments.
   - **Availability**: Standard Public IP addresses are billed based on usage, including a small hourly charge for each IP address and additional charges for data transfer. They are available for reservation without associating them with a specific resource.
   - **Static Assignment**: Standard Public IP addresses can be statically assigned to resources, ensuring that the IP address remains constant even if the resource is stopped and restarted.
   - **Advanced Features**: Standard Public IP addresses offer advanced features such as availability zones support, outbound FQDN-based NAT, Public IP Prefix, and DDoS protection.

In summary, the Basic SKU for Public IP addresses is suitable for simple scenarios where basic functionality is required and cost-effectiveness is a priority. On the other hand, the Standard SKU offers advanced features and capabilities for more complex networking requirements and production workloads, albeit with associated costs based on usage. When choosing between the two SKUs, consider your specific requirements for features, availability, and cost.

2. **Private IP Addresses**:
   - Private IP addresses in Azure are non-routable addresses used for communication within a VNet or between connected VNets. They are not directly accessible from the internet.
   - Private IP addresses are typically used for:
     - Internal communication: Allowing Azure resources within the same VNet to communicate with each other.
     - Connectivity between VNets: Enabling communication between resources deployed in different VNets within the same Azure region.
   - Azure automatically assigns private IP addresses to resources deployed within a VNet's subnets. The IP addresses are allocated from the range of IP addresses defined for each subnet.

   - **Static Private IP Address**: In Azure, private IP addresses assigned to virtual machines (VMs) or other resources within a Virtual Network (VNet) can be static or dynamic. A static private IP address is an IP address that remains constant and does not change unless manually modified. Static private IP addresses are useful for scenarios where you need a consistent IP address for communication within the VNet or between connected VNets.
   - **Dynamic Private IP Address**: A dynamic private IP address is an IP address that is automatically assigned by Azure from the defined address space of the subnet within the VNet. Dynamic private IP addresses are suitable for scenarios where you do not require a specific IP address and are willing to let Azure handle the assignment automatically. This is the default behavior for private IP addresses in Azure.
     
### Note:
You can attach multiple private IPs to a VM but not public IPs.

In summary, public IP addresses are used for communication with the internet, while private IP addresses are used for internal communication within a VNet or between connected VNets. Understanding the distinction between public and private IP addresses is crucial for designing and implementing network architectures in Azure that meet security, performance, and connectivity requirements.
