In Azure, connecting virtual networks (VNets) across regions or subscriptions or on-premises can be accomplished using VNet-to-VNet (V2V) connections. This setup is often used to establish communication between resources deployed in different Azure regions or subscriptions securely.

To create a VNet-to-VNet connection, you typically utilize Azure Virtual Network Gateways. Here's a general overview of the process:

1. **Create Virtual Networks**: You need to have at least two virtual networks that you want to connect. These VNets can be in the same or different Azure regions, or even different subscriptions.

2. **Create Virtual Network Gateways**: For each VNet, you'll need to create a Virtual Network Gateway. These gateways serve as the endpoints for the VNet-to-VNet connections. When creating the gateways, you specify the VNet they belong to and the gateway type (VPN Gateway).

3. **Configure Gateway Subnets**: Each VNet must have a gateway subnet. This subnet is used by the Virtual Network Gateway to establish the VPN connection. When creating the gateway, Azure prompts you to select or create a gateway subnet.
  ### Note:
    You can not deploy a vm in Gateway subnet.It is a special type of gateway to deploy vpn.

4. **Configure Connection**: After creating the gateways, you configure the VNet-to-VNet connection. In this step, you specify the local and remote network gateways to connect. You also define the connection type, authentication method (usually pre-shared key), and other settings.

5. **Establish Connection**: Once the configuration is done, Azure establishes the connection between the VNets through the Virtual Network Gateways. This process may take a few minutes to complete.

6. **Test Connectivity**: After the connection is established, you should test the connectivity between resources in the connected VNets to ensure everything is working as expected.

Keep in mind that creating and managing VNet-to-VNet connections may incur additional costs, especially for the Virtual Network Gateways. It's essential to review Azure's pricing documentation to understand the cost implications of such configurations.

Also, consider security and compliance requirements when setting up VNet-to-VNet connections, especially if you're dealing with sensitive data or regulatory constraints. Encryption and proper access controls should be in place to protect the traffic traversing the VPN connection.
