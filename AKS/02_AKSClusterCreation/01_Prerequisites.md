## Prerequisites for AKS Cluster

Before creating an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, there are several prerequisites you need to fulfill to ensure a smooth deployment process. Here's a checklist of the prerequisites:

1. **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free Azure account.

2. **Azure Resource Group**: Decide on the Azure resource group where you want to deploy your AKS cluster. If you haven't created one yet, you can create a new resource group using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

3. **Azure CLI or Azure Portal Access**: You can use either the Azure CLI or the Azure portal to create and manage AKS clusters. Make sure you have access to one of these tools( <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/" > Azure CLI </a> ).

4. **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Integration (Optional)**: If you want to enable Azure Active Directory integration for AKS cluster authentication and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), ensure that you have the necessary permissions to manage Azure AD.

5. **Service Principal (SP) for AKS**: Create a service principal (SP) in Azure AD if you plan to use RBAC with Azure AD integration. The SP is used by AKS to interact with Azure APIs on your behalf.

6. **Virtual Network (VNet)**: Decide whether you want to create a new VNet for your AKS cluster or use an existing one. If you're creating a new VNet, plan its address space and subnet configuration.

7. **Subnet for AKS**: Create a subnet within the chosen VNet to host the AKS cluster nodes. Ensure that the subnet has sufficient IP address space and meets the AKS subnet requirements.

8. **Azure Container Registry (ACR) (Optional)**: If you plan to use Azure Container Registry for storing and managing Docker container images, ensure that you have created an ACR instance.

9. **Networking Considerations**: Familiarize yourself with AKS networking concepts such as network policies, ingress controllers, and outbound internet connectivity requirements based on your application architecture.

10. **Resource Quotas and Limits**: Understand the Azure subscription limits and AKS quotas, especially related to the maximum number of nodes, node pools, and cluster sizes allowed per subscription.

By completing these prerequisites, you'll be well-prepared to create an AKS cluster and start deploying your containerized applications on Azure Kubernetes Service.
