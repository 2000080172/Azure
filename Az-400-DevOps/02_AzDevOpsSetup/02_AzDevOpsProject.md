# Projects in Azure DevOps

In **Azure DevOps**, a **Project** is a central unit where you manage all aspects of your software development lifecycle. It provides a structured environment for planning, developing, testing, and delivering software. Here’s a detailed guide on what a project is, how to create one, and the features it includes.

## **What is a Project in Azure DevOps?**

A **Project** in Azure DevOps acts as a container for various resources related to a specific software development effort. It groups together tools and services to manage the development process, including:

- **Code Repositories:** Store and manage source code using Git or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).
- **Work Items:** Track and manage features, tasks, bugs, and user stories.
- **Pipelines:** Automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Boards:** Plan and track work using Kanban boards, backlogs, and sprints.
- **Test Plans:** Manage test cases, execute test plans, and track results.
- **Artifacts:** Manage and share packages for your applications.

### **Key Components of a Project**

- **Repos (Repositories):** Stores source code and manages versions.
- **Boards:** Manages work items, sprints, and backlogs.
- **Pipelines:** Automates builds and deployments.
- **Test Plans:** Manages test cases and test execution.
- **Artifacts:** Hosts package feeds and dependencies.
